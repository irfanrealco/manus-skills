## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Explore the Registry

```python
from lib.skill_registry import SkillRegistry

registry = SkillRegistry()

# Get statistics
stats = registry.get_stats()
print(f"Total skills: {stats['total_skills']}")

# Find skills by category
tier1 = registry.find_by_category("tier1-foundation")
print(f"Foundation skills: {tier1}")

# Find skills by tag
db_skills = registry.find_by_tag("database")
print(f"Database skills: {db_skills}")
```

### 2. Compose a Workflow

```python
from lib.skill_composer import SkillComposer

composer = SkillComposer(registry)

# Define workflow
skills = [
    "database-schema-generator",
    "api-endpoint-builder",
    "testing-framework"
]

# Compose and validate
workflow = composer.compose_workflow(skills)
print(f"Valid: {workflow['valid']}")
print(f"Order: {workflow['dependencies']}")
```

### 3. Use a Meta-Skill

```bash
python3 meta-skills/full-stack-builder/scripts/build_app.py \
  "SaaS app with auth and payments" \
  payments,email
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system uses a **5-layer architecture**:

```
Layer 5: Meta-Skills (Orchestration)
         ↓
Layer 4: Discovery System (Registry & Composer)
         ↓
Layer 3: Individual Skills (55 skills)
         ↓
Layer 2: Shared Utilities (Common code)
         ↓
Layer 1: Foundation (Standards & patterns)
```

### Key Components

1. **Skill Registry** (`skills.json`) - Central manifest with metadata
2. **Shared Utilities** (`lib/`) - Common code for all skills
3. **Discovery System** - Find and suggest complementary skills
4. **Dependency Graph** - Automatic ordering and resolution
5. **Meta-Skills** - High-level orchestrators

## 💡 Example Workflows

### Build a SaaS Application

```python
workflow = registry.suggest_workflow("build a SaaS app")
# Returns: [brainstorming, database-schema-generator, api-endpoint-builder, 
#           user-authentication-system, testing-framework, deployment-automation]
```

### Add Payment Integration

```python
workflow = composer.compose_workflow([
    "payment-integration",
    "testing-framework",
    "deployment-automation"
])
```

### Create a New Skill

```bash
python3 skills/utility-skills/skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py my-new-skill
```
